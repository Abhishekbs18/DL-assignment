# Age Prediction using SVR and Neural Network

This repository contains code for predicting age based on various features using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. The dataset includes information such as length, diameter, height, weight, and other features. The SVR model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.3788, while the DNN improved the performance to a MAE of 1.3626. The code also includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
